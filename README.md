C# application that runs in system tray, listens for keypress and makes mechanical keyboard noises as you type. Keypress volume is adjustable in realtime using the slider provided. Currently supports two types of sounds: Default(becomes monotonous quite easily) and NK-Cream. Feel free to add your own sounds!
